# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction Project

Welcome to the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction Project! ðŸš€

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer lifetime value using a comprehensive dataset. We employed a combination of regression, clustering, and classification techniques to extract meaningful insights and enhance decision-making processes.

## Project Structure

- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks detailing the step-by-step process of the project.
  - `Customer_Lifetime_Value_Prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook showcasing the data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and analysis.
  
- **`data/`**: Holds the dataset used for this project.
  - `customer_data.csv`: The raw dataset containing customer information.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
